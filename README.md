## Hi there 👋

I'm Abdullah, a Web Developer developer based in UAE.
I mainly focus on frontend - React, Javascript, Bootstrap and some experience in Django.
I also use Figma for UI design and affinity for brainstorming and framer motion for animations.
This is my profile that I use to upload my Projects & coding exercises also any other thing that I'm developing on the side, so everything here is made from scratch as far scratch goes with frameworks and coding exercises. No heavy use of AI and definitely no copy-paste.

<br/>

Tools & Tech:
- React, ES6+, Bootstrap.
- Framer motion (for animations).
- Figma, Notion, Affinity.

<br/>

About me:
- 🎮 I'm an avid gamer.
- 🛠 building small projects is my favorite past time.
- 🎯 I'm hyper focused when I put my mind into something.
